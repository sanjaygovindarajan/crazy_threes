The rules are as follows:
Each player is dealt 9 cards, the balance of the cards becomes the deck. The first card is placed
face up in the center, becoming the top card of the disposed deck. If a three is turned, it is
buried in the middle of the deck.
Each player must place one card face up on the disposed deck on their turn. Each card played
(other than a three) must match the card showing on the discard pile, either suit or in
denomination.
Example: if the 4 of Clubs if the top card in the discard pile, any clubs may be played on it or
any 4s.
If unable to play, cards are drawn from the top of the face down deck until a play is possible, or
until the deck is empty. If unable to play when the deck is empty, the disposed deck is shuffled
and set face down as the deck except for the top card that stays as the top cards from the
disposed deck and then continue to draw cards until they can play.
Threes are wild! That is, a three may be played at any time in turn, and the player need only
specify a suit for it (but never a number). The next player must play either a card of the specified
suit or a three.
The player that runs out of cards wins! You can save your wins by saving the game and
accumulate them by loading your game and play again with the same people.
