# Crazy three's
Objectively the best CSC207 project ever created
This is a multiplayer card game based on the same computer.
The players can choose to play against each other and/or bots.
Once the game starts, the program shuffles the deck and hands out the starting hands out the starign hands to the Players.
Each player must play a card or draw a card from the Deck
If th deck runs out of cards from the disposed cards pile would be returned to the deck except for the top card, and then
the deck would be shuffled.  To win the game, one of the players must have discarded all their cards
The history of wins would only be cataloged as long as the same conditions remain, if the user starts a new game with different players, the history will be reset to 0.
