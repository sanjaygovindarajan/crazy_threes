# Crazy three's
## What is Crazy Threes?
In short, it is objectively the best CSC207 project ever created.
It is a multiplayer card game up to five users can play against each other on the same computer.
The game is based on the classic card game "Crazy 8's", except 3's can be used to change the suit of the playing deck instead of 8's!
A refreser of rules:
Each player will be dealt cards to begin.
You can play any card that is either the same suit or the same number as the previously played card.
You can always play a 3 even if the previous card was a different suit or number, and when you play a 3 you get to decide what suit the gameplay will change to.
## How to run the program?
Compile and run the file out/app/Main.java.
First, the program will prompt you to type whether you would like to play a new game, load an existing game or view the rules.
If you press Start Game, the program will show the panel to enter the players' names. You can choose to play with bots, if so you need to enter "#" before the name to indicate it is a bot.
The first player needs to be a player, the rest of the spaces can be bot or player (up to 5 players allowed).
At any player's turn they are allowed to view the rules before they play in case they forget how to play!
Additionally, while playing, you can choose to save your game by typing a name to the game and pressing Save Game button in the bottom right of the screen.
To return to your game, you need to exit the game, load the app again press Load Game and select your game to resume where you left off.
If you want to play a card, just select the card you want to play that matches the suit or the number.
The program will show you the last card of the deck of which you have to play to, so you can decide which card you want to/are allowed to play.
However, if you select a card that is not allowed (like playing the 2 of diamonds when the previous played card was 6 of spades), the program will inform you that the command was not accepted and allow you to make a new play.
Once a player plays every card in their hand, the game ends, and they win!!!
## How can I learn the rules?
Press View Rules at the Lobby panel before starting or loading a game, or if you want to access the rules while playing you can select the button View Rules at the bottom left of the screen.
